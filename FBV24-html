    <h2>Waste and Household</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Waste:There is two containers by the entrance to the property</li>
      <li>Sorting: General waste goes in the green container. The blue container is for carboard and paper. If you like to help me resirculate plastic please leave it in the open room between the house and the garage.</li>
      <li>Washing machine: The washingroom is in the room just below the stairs. It has a washing machine and a dryer. As the signs and info is in Norwegian I have made a video to show how to use it here: https://photos.app.goo.gl/7dXXUfak1Q34etos6 </li>
      <li>Dishwasher: There are two in the main floor, and one in the downstairs appartment</li>
      <li>Air conditioning: Use the white remote on the wall close to the AC unit. Use "mode" to select heating (shows a sun symbol), fan (fan symbol) or cooling (ice symbol), select fan speed to select if you would like to adjust the speed. Regulate the temperature with the "+" and "-" symbol </li>
      <li>Vacuum and cleaning supplies: There are several vacuum cleaners - a battery driven one is on the side of the kitchen towards the window, a vacuum cleaner with power below the stairs or in the washing room, and there is also one in the appartment. For cleaning supplies there are some in the kitchen door closest to the entrance as well as in the washingroom downstairs</li>

  <section id="tips">
    <h2>Things to do in Bergen</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Bryggen Hanseatic Wharf:</strong> Explore this UNESCO World Heritage Site, lined with colorful wooden buildings dating back to the Hanseatic era – this is the typical “Photo of Bergen”. Don't forget to visit the Hanseatic Museum to learn about Bergen's trading history if that interests you.</li>
      <li><strong>Fløibanen Funicular:</strong> Take a ride on the Fløibanen funicular up Mount Fløyen for panoramic views of the city and surrounding fjords. There are hiking trails, several playgrounds for kids (make sure to check inside the forest as the “largest one” is about 700 meters in with slides etc). The restaurant at the top of Fløyen has just reopened and is worth a visit. <a href="https://www.floyen.no/en" target="_blank">Visit website</a></li>
      <li><strong>Ulriken Cable Car (643 meters above sea level):</strong> This is my favorite trip. I usually take the stairs up (starting from the cable car entry, with some regular hills first, then fantastic stone stairs). If you enjoy exercise, I recommend Ulriken over Fløyen, though Fløyen is more well-known and accessible from the city center. On clear days, you can see all the way to the North Sea. <a href="https://ulriken643.no/en" target="_blank">Visit website</a></li>
      <li><strong>Fish Market (Fisketorget):</strong> Experience Bergen's bustling seafood scene at the Fish Market, where you can sample fresh seafood and local delicacies like smoked salmon, and interact with vendors.</li>
      <li><strong>Edvard Grieg Museum at Troldhaugen:</strong> Visit the former home of Norway's famous composer, located just a short walk from the house. Explore the museum, Grieg's villa, and enjoy summer concerts. <a href="https://www.kodebergen.no/en/museums/troldhaugen" target="_blank">Visit website</a></li>
      <li><strong>St. Mary's Church (Mariakirken):</strong> Admire the architecture of Bergen's oldest surviving church, dating back to the 12th century, featuring frescoes and medieval artwork. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary%27s_Church,_Bergen" target="_blank">Read more</a></li>
      <li><strong>Nordnes Park:</strong> Take a stroll through this scenic park on a peninsula. Visit the outdoor pool (Nordnes Sjøbad – highly recommended if the weather is nice: heated pool, sea swimming, and picnic spots). <a href="https://nordnessjobad.no/en" target="_blank">Visit website</a></li>
      <li><strong>Bergenhus Fortress:</strong> Discover Bergen's medieval history through the Rosenkrantz Tower, Haakon's Hall, and King Magnus’s fortress. Guided tours are available.</li>
      <li><strong>KODE Art Museums:</strong> A great collection of Norwegian and international art, including works by Edvard Munch and Nikolai Astrup.</li>
      <li><strong>Sognefjord Cruise:</strong> Take a day trip to explore Norway’s longest and deepest fjord. The cruise offers waterfalls, glaciers, and charming villages. <a href="https://www.fjordnorway.com/en/inspiration/fjord-cruise-sognefjord" target="_blank">Visit website</a></li>
